**month** - see example

**basicWeek** - see example

**basicDay** - see example


Basic Display Options
=====================

**year, month, date**: Integers
	The initial year/month/date when the calendar loads.
	
	``month`` is 1-based, meaning January=1, February=2, etc
	(different from previous versions)
	
	If ommitted, the calendar starts on the current date.

**header**: Object, *Default*: ``{ left:'title', center:'', right:'prev,next' }``
	Defines the buttons/text at the top of the calendar. Must be an
	object with properties left, center, and right. Omitting a property
	will cause it to inherit from the default.
	
	Property values contain a comma-separated string with any of the
	following items:
	
		``title``
			text containing the current date or date-range
		
		``prev``
			button for moving the calendar back one month/week/day,
			depending on the current view
		
		``next``
			button for moving the calendar forward one month/week/day,
			depending on the current view
		
		*a view name...*
			button that will switch the calendar to any of the
			available views
		
	Using an empty space as a separator instead of a comma will cause
	adjacent buttons/text to be separated by a visual gap.
	
	Specifying an empty string for left, center, or right will cause
	the area to be empty.
	
**defaultView**: String, *Default*: ``'month'``
	The initial view then the calendar loads. Any of the available views.

**aspectRatio**: Float, *Default*: ``1.35``
	A calendar is a block-level element that fills its entire avaiable width.
	The calendar's height, however, is determined by this ratio of width-to-height.
	(Hint: larger numbers make smaller heights).

**weekMode**: String, *Default*: ``'fixed'``
	Determines the number of weeks displayed in a month view.
	Also determines each week's height. Available options:
	
		``'fixed'``
			The calendar will always be 6 weeks tall.
			The aspectRatio will always be maintained.
		
		``'liquid'``
			The calendar will have either 4, 5, or 6 weeks, depending on the month.
			The height of the weeks will stretch to fill the available height,
			as determined by aspectRatio.
		
		``'variable'``
			The calendar will have either 4, 5, or 6 weeks, depending on the month.
			The aspectRatio will NOT be maintained however. Each week will have
			a constant height, meaning the calendar will change height month-to-month.
	
	
Event Editing
=============

**editable**: Boolean, *Default*: ``false``
	Whether the events on the calendar can be modified, i.e,
	if the events will be draggable and resizable.
	This can be overridden on a per-event basis with an event's
	editable property.
	
	For dragging, the jQuery UI draggable library is required.
	For resizing, the jQuery UI resizable library is required.
	Both require the jQuery UI core.
	
**disableDragging**: Boolean, *Default*: ``false``
	Disables all event dragging, even when events are editable

**disableResizing**: Boolean, *Default*: ``false``
	Disables all event resizing, even when events are editable
	
**dragOpacity**: Float, *Default*: ``1.0``
	The opacity of an event when it is being dragged.

**dragRevertDuration**: Float, *Default*: ``500``
	The time in milliseconds it takes for an event to revert to its
	original position after un unsuccessful drag.
	
	
Time & Date Formatting
======================

**titleFormat**: String/Object
	Determines the text that will be displayed in the header's title
	using formatDates' format string. A string will set the title format
	for ALL views. An object hash will set the format on a per-view basis.
	Here is the default, showing example outputs for each view::
	
		{
			month: 'MMMM yyyy', // September 2009
			week: "MMM d[ yyyy]{ '&#8212;'[ MMM] d yyyy}", // Sep 7 - 13 2009
			day: 'dddd, MMM d, yyyy' // Tuesday, Sep 8, 2009
		}

**columnFormat**: String/Object
	Determines the text that will be displayed on a view's column headers
	using formatDates' format string. A string will set the column header format
	for ALL views. An object hash will set the format on a per-view basis.
	Here is the default, showing example outputs for each view::
	
		{
			month: 'ddd', // Mon
			week: 'ddd M/d', // Mon 9/7
			day: 'dddd M/d' // Monday 9/7
		}

**timeFormat**: String, Default: ``'h(:mm)t'``
	Determines the time-text that will be displayed on an event
	using formatDates' format string. The default format outputs text
	such as 9a or 5:30p.
	
	Time-text will only be displayed for event objects that have
	allDay equal to false.

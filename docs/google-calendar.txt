
Google Calendar
===============

To integrate with your Google Calendar, you must first **make your calendar public**:

#. In the Google Calendar interface, locate the "My Calendar" box on the left.

#. Click the arrow next to the calendar you need.

#. A menu will appear. Click "Share this calendar."

#. Check "Make this calendar public."

#. Make sure "Share only my free/busy information" is *unchecked*.

#. Click "Save."

Then, you must obtain your calendar's **XML feed URL**.

#. In the Google Calendar interface, locate the "My Calendar" box on the left

#. Click the arrow next to the calendar you need.

#. A menu will appear. Click "Calendar settings."

#. In the "Calendar Address" section of the screen, click the XML badge.

#. Your feed's URL will appear.

The API for integrating a Google Calendar feed has changed since
FullCalendar 1.1. The ``$.fullCalendar.gcalFeed`` function now produces
an event source that can be passed to the ``events`` or ``eventSources``
option::

   $('#calendar').fullCalendar({
      
      events: $.fullCalendar.gcalFeed(
         "http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/...",   // feed URL
         { className: 'gcal-events' }                  // optional options
      )
      
   });
   
Here is a list of available options:

* **className** - CSS class to attach to each event from this Google Calendar

* **draggable** - whether to allow dragging (default: ``false``)
   
See *gcal.html* in the *examples* directory for a complete example.

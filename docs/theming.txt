FullCalendar can be used with jQuery UI themes. Themes provide a more stylized
look for the calendar and can easily be created using the
`jQuery UI ThemeRoller <http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/>`_.

In order for themes to work, you must include the theme's CSS file and
*fullcalendar.css* on the current page. You must also enable the ``theme`` option.
Here is the full list of theme-related options:

**theme**: Boolean, *Default*: ``false``
	Enables/disables use of jQuery UI themes

**buttonIcons**: Object
	Determines which icons appear within header buttons. If a button
	does not have an entry, it falls back to using ``buttonText``.
	
	Here is the default value for ``buttonIcons``::
	
		{
			prev: 'circle-triangle-w',
			next: 'circle-triangle-e'
		}

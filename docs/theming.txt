
Theming
=======

FullCalendar can be used with jQuery UI themes. Themes provide a more stylized
look for the calendar and can easily be created using the jQuery UI ThemeRoller.

In order for themes to work, you must include the theme's CSS file AND
fullcalendar.css on the current page. You must also enable the ``theme`` option.
Here is the full list of theme-related options:

	theme: Boolean (default: false)
		Enables/disables use of jQuery UI themes
	
	buttonIcons: Object
		Determines which icons appear within header buttons. If a button
		does not have an entry, it falls back to using buttonText.
	
		Here is the default value for buttonIcons:
		
			{
				prev: 'circle-triangle-w',
				next: 'circle-triangle-e'
			}

Triggered Actions
=================

The following options are *functions* that get executed every time something
special happens. For every triggered action, a final ``view`` parameter is
always available (:ref:`more below <view-object>`). 

**viewDisplay**: function(*view*)
	Triggered once when the calendar loads and every time the
	calendar's view is changed. This includes when the prev or next
	button is pressed.

**loading**: function(*isLoading, view*)
	Triggered with a ``true`` argument when the calendar begins fetching
	events via AJAX. Triggered with ``false`` when done.

**windowResize**: function(*view*)
	Triggered after the calendar's dimensions have been changed due to
	the containing window being resized.
	
	``this`` is set to the main element.

**dayClick**: function(*dayDate, allDay, jsEvent, view*)
	Triggered when the user clicks on a day. ``dayDate`` is a Date object holding the
	current date and time (if in an agenda view) of the clicked area.
	
	``allDay`` will be ``true`` when the user clicks on a day in month-view
	or the "all-day" slot in the agenda views. It will be ``false`` when the user
	clicks on a slot in the agenda views.
	
	``jsEvent`` is the native javascript event (with information about click position, etc).
	
	``this`` is set to the TD element of the clicked day.

**eventRender**: function(*calEvent, element, view*)
	Triggered before an element is rendered for the given :ref:`CalEvent <CalEvents>`.
	``element`` is the jQuery element that will be used by default. You may modify
	this element or return a brand new element that will be used instead.
	Returning ``false`` will prevent the event from being rendered at all.
	
	This function is great for attaching other jQuery plugins to each event
	element, such as a `qTip <http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/docs/>`_
	tooltip effect.

**eventClick**, **eventMouseover**, **eventMouseout**: function(*calEvent, jsEvent, view*)
	Triggered on click/mouseover/mouseout actions for an event.
	``calEvent`` holds that event's information (date, title, etc).
	``jsEvent`` holds the native javascript event (with information about click position, etc).
	
	``this`` is set to the event's element
	
	For ``eventClick``, return ``false`` to prevent the browser from going to
	the event's URL.

**eventDragStart**, **eventDragStop**: function(*calEvent, jsEvent, ui, view*)
	Triggered before/after an event is dragged (but not necessarily moved to a new day/time).
	``calEvent`` holds that event's information (date, title, etc).
	``jsEvent`` holds the native javascript event (with information about click position, etc).
	``ui`` holds the jQuery UI object.
	
	``this`` is set to the event's element

**eventDrop**: function(*calEvent, dayDelta, minuteDelta, allDay, revertFunc, jsEvent, ui, view*)
	Triggered when dragging stops and the event has moved to a *different* day/time.
	
	``dayDelta`` holds the number of days the event was moved forward (a positive number)
	or backwards (a negative number).
	
	``minuteDelta`` holds the number of minutes the event was moved forward (a positive number)
	or backwards (a negative number). Only applies to the agenda views.
	
	``dayDelta`` and ``minuteDelta`` are elegant for dealing with multi-day and
	repeating events. If updating a remote database, just add these values to the
	start and end times of all events with the given ``calEvent.id``
	
	``allDay`` is ``true`` if the event has been dropped on a day in month-view or the
	"all-day" slot in the agenda views. It will be ``false`` if dropped on a slot
	in the agenda views.
	
	``revertFunc`` is a function that, if called, reverts the event's start/end date to
	the values *before* the drag. This is useful if an ajax call should fail.

**eventResizeStart**, **eventResizeStop**: function(*calEvent, jsEvent, ui, view*)
	Triggered before/after an event is resized (but not necessarily changed).
	``calEvent`` holds that event's information (date, title, etc).
	``jsEvent`` holds the native javascript event (with information about click position, etc).
	``ui`` holds the jQuery UI object.
	
	``this`` is set to the event's element

**eventResize**: function(*calEvent, dayDelta, minuteDelta, revertFunc, jsEvent, ui, view*)
	Triggered when an event is resized and *changed in duration*.
	
	``dayDelta`` holds the number of days the event's end time was moved
	forward (a positive number) or backwards (a negative number).
	
	``minuteDelta`` holds the number of minutes the event's end time was moved
	forward (a positive number) or backwards (a negative number).
	Only applies to the agenda views.
	
	``revertFunc`` is a function that, if called, reverts the event's start/end date to
	the values *before* the drag. This is useful if an ajax call should fail.


.. _view-object:
	
View Object
===========

The final parameter of every triggered action is a *view* object. It contains information about the
current view (whether month/basicWeek/basicDay) and contains the following properties:

**name**: String
	Name of one of the available views (month, basicWeek, basicDay)

**title**: String
	Title text that is displayed at the top of the header
	(such as "September 2009" or "Sep 7 - 13 2009").

**start**: Date
	The Date of the first day of the month/week.
	If day-view, the Date of the single day.

**end**: Date
	The Date of the day *after* the last day of the month/week.
	If day-view, the Date *after* the single day.
	
	Because this is an *exclusive* value, if the calendar has a
	month-view on October 2009, ``end`` will be November 1st.

**visStart**: Date
	The Date of the first *visible* day of the view. In month-view,
	this value is often before the 1st day of the month, because most
	months do not begin on a Monday.
	
	In week and day views, this value will always be the same as ``start``.

**visEnd**: Date
	The Date of the day *after* the last visible day
	(because it is exclusive like ``end``).

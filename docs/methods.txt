
Methods
=======

The folling are a list of methods that can be called on an FullCalendar-initialized
jQuery object:

	prev			.fullCalendar('prev')
		Moves the calendar one step back (either by a month, week, or day).

	next			.fullCalendar('next')
		Moves the calendar one step forward (either by a month, week, or day).
		
	today			.fullCalendar('today')
		Moves the calendar to the current date.
	
	gotoDate		.fullCalendar('gotoDate', year, month, date)
		Moves the calendar to an arbitrary year/month/date.
		
		``month`` is 1-based, meaning January=1, February=2, etc
		(different from previous versions of FullCalendar)
	
	moveDate		.fullCalendar('moveDate', years, months, days)
		Moves the calendar forward/backward an arbitrary amount of time
	
	updateEvent		.fullCalendar('renderEvent', calEvent)
		Reports changes to the given calEvent. This will cause the event
		to be rerendered on the calendar.
		
		If there are repeating events on the calendar with the
		same ID, these events will be changed as well.
		
		``calEvent`` must be an object retrieved from a triggered event
		or from clientEvents.
	
	renderEvent		.fullCalendar('renderEvent', calEvent, stick)
		Renders a new event on the calendar. ``calEvent`` must have
		at least a ``title`` and a ``start``.
		
		By default the event will disappear once the user switches views
		or clicks prev/next. However, specifying ``stick`` as ``true``
		will cause the event to be permanently fixed to the calendar.
	
	removeEvents	.fullCalendar('removeEvent', idOrFilter)
		If the second argument is omitted, all events are removed.
		
		If the second argument is a calEvent ID, all events with
		the same ID will be removed.
		
		The second argument may be a filter function that accepts
		one calEvent argument and returns ``true`` or ``false`` about
		whether is should be removed.
		
	clientEvents	.fullCalendar('clientEvents', idOrFilter)
		This method will return calEvents that FullCalendar has stored on
		the client-side (javascript in the browser).
		
		If the second argument is omitted, all events will be returned.
		
		If the second argument is a calEvent ID, all events with the
		same ID will be returned.
		
		The second argument may also be a filter function that accepts
		one calEvent argument and returns ``true`` or ``false`` about
		whether it should be included in the result set.

	addEventSource		.fullCalendar('addEventSource', source)
		Adds an event source. ``source`` may be an array/string/function just as in
		the ``events`` option. Events will be immediately fetched from this source
		and placed on the calendar.

	removeEventSource	.fullCalendar('removeEventSource', source)
		Remove an event source. ``source`` must be a reference to the
		original array/string/function.

	rerenderEvents		.fullCalendar('rerenderEvents')
		Rerenders all events on the screen.

	refetchEvents		.fullCalendar('refetchEvents')
		Refetches events from all event sources and rerenders them on the screen.
